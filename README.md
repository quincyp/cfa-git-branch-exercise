## Git Cheat Sheet
| Git Command | Basically what it does according to my quick write-up|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `git clone <GITHUB_REPO_LINK>` | clones the remote repo to your local machine's current directory; only do this once for initial setup  |
| `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>` | creates your own branch to safely work on an individual branch |
| `git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>` | checkout an existing branch to work on |
| `git status` | returns the current status / changes  |
| `git add <FILE_NAME>*` | adds changes for committing |
| `git commit -m "<CHANGES MADE GO HERE>"` | commits the changes |
| `git push` | pushes the changes to the remote repo on github |
| `git pull` | pulls changes that have been made on the remote repo (by your teammates) |
| `git reset` | unstages adds/commits that have not been pushed yet |
